üíûÔ∏è I‚Äôm looking to collaborate on an app to do this: 

I'm seeking an app developer for a 'save democracy and the ecology' activism purpose.  A place to share mutual benefit topics (ending war, racism, sexism, ecological destruction) agree on time/ place to locally voice concerns alone, with neighbors or at a bigger rally, then have those small or big local actions uploaded into a unified single message to media and the decision makers like elected and corporate officials. "Today 15,000 sent congress a message to end Citizens United."for example. 
In time globally scalable with translation and member chat functions. 
Monetized by individuals,  organizations and select corporate contributions. 
Will need protection from hackers and provocateurs.
